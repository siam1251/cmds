### Quick coding style    

* Use enum whenver is possible
* Use class whenever is possible

### Quick Algorithm tips    

* If state representation is easy then bottom-up dp is also easy  
* start bottom-up from the opposite end of top-down

### Bucket sort or counting sort pattern  

* If there is another feature where the value ranges are small (0-1000) then probably try buckek or counting sort     
* If there is a time series

### Creating O(1) access, insert, delete, search using Hashmap, vector, list, set    
* Ask the following questings

   * finding anything in constant time, use map or set
  * How to erase an element constant time (linkedlist)
  * Is order required in linkedlist or vector
  * you can pop last element from vector in constant time
